# Instruction set and basic architecture 

## Registers | All registers are 16 bit

 -  A, B : Math Registers
	- The registers used when preforming math operations. Result automatically put into AO register.
	-  A is always the primary number in the operation.
		- A - B,   A % B,	!A 
- C, D, E, F : General Purpose Registers
	- Simply store a value.
- SR : Stat Register
	- Bits 13-15 reserved for ALU flags. Read only.
	- Sub-section Breakdown
		- Bits 0-7: IO select, can be set directly by "Set IO" (Instruction 10).
		- Bits 8-11: ALU operation select, can be set directly by "Set ALU" (Instruction 9).
		- Bit 12: SWAP flag, used to swap highest bit of memory addresses to increase total memory.
		- Bit 13: ALU carry flag.
		- Bit 14: ALU zero flag.
		- Bit 15: ALU not zero flag.
- PC: Program Counter
	- Current position of the CPU is executing from.
	- Can be set like any other register.
- AO: ALU Output
	- **Read only**
	- Automatically set based on inputs from registers A, B, and SR.
## ALU Operations
- Numbers corispond to what the ALU operation select flag should be set to for a given operation.
- All operators needed to be a single character, some may have unusual or non-standard operands
